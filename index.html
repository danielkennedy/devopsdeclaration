    <h1 class="title">The DevOps Declaration</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2 class="subtitle">Preamble</h2>

    <p class="preamble">We are the dedicated professionals who make software available to
    users. We span the life cycle of an application, from idea through implementation and
    back again. We create, build, deploy, maintain, repair and listen to feedback from
    users of our solution. Our individual experiences have led to a collective
    understanding and, in turn, a clear vision about the right way to participate in the
    delivery of products to market. We are the people who establish, nurture, and
    champion the DevOps culture, and the following is our declaration.</p>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Principles</h2>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Focus on people
    first.&nbsp;</span>Technology, tools, and processes are helpful, but our success will
    always be the product of our team.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Collaborate across
    functions.&nbsp;</span>Everyone contributes to the delivery of software. Our job is
    not done until every job is done.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Practice absolute
    transparency.&nbsp;</span>Decisions are made in the open. Motivations are clear and
    discussions are welcome.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Understand your
    users.&nbsp;</span>Every member of our team talks to our users. Actively seeking
    feedback makes our software better.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Help others help
    themselves.&nbsp;</span>Self service systems increase responsiveness to our users,
    and free us to make a large impact with a small team.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Question the status
    quo.&nbsp;</span>The scientific method is applied across the entire organization.
    Everything is subject to improvement.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Drive decisions with
    data.&nbsp;</span>Information is constantly gathered, analyzed, and shared. Questions
    are answered, and answers are understood.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Do work that
    matters.&nbsp;</span>Belief in the software we deliver, the organization we support,
    and the users we serve is the ultimate motivation.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Look forward to
    growth.&nbsp;</span>Software and systems are designed to deliver immediate value,
    while accounting for future scalability.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Build confidence with
    testing.&nbsp;</span>Tests are conducted early and often. Everything is code. Results
    are communicated to everyone. Quality is an outcome, not a task.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Automate the life
    cycle.&nbsp;</span>Barriers between development and production are overcome with
    predictable, repeatable automation. Changes are welcomed without fear.</p>

    <p class="principle"><span class="self-evident">Deliver
    continuously.&nbsp;</span>Software is ready for users at all times. Production
    releases are simple, low-risk, and frequent. We are responsive, not reactive.</p>
